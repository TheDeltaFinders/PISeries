	\stConfTitle 
\begin{abstract}
This paper describes one of many possible ways to calculate the value of $\pi$ with a geometrical series. This method will be particulary useful to calculate the value of $\pi$ with iterative approach taking terms as per the required precision.
\end{abstract}


\section{Introduction}
$\pi$ comes flying all over high school mathematics. Beginner studensts often confuse the number $\pi$ with $180^0$ or $\frac{22}{7}$ which in fact is just a crude approximation of $\pi$. The approach taken in this paper will help beginners understand what actually is $\pi$.


\section{Historical Note}
Intuitively we can also guess that if we make bigger and bigger circle both diameter and circumference increase. It makes us wonder if there is a certain relation between the diameter and circumference of circle. Curious Babylonians in the early ages, out of similar curiosity, tried to measure the ratio of circumference to diameter. Unsurprisingly they found the ratio was close to $3$. For various observations they found this ratio was always closer to 3, little greater than 3 and never larger than 4. They didn't precisely know the value of the ratio. So they named the ratio a magical symbol, which is $\pi$.
\section{Random }
Some random sentences to begin the section formally.
\begin{Definition}
	\emph{ $\pi$ is the ratio of circumference to diameter of a circle. i.e., $\pi = \frac{C}{d}$, where $C$ is the circumference, $d$ is the diameter of circle}
\end{Definition}
Using this definition of circumference of circle, it is not hard to work out the area of circle. As it turns out the area of circle in terms of the named constant comes out to be \footnote{The derivation of $A = \pi r^2$ is given in Appendix A}\[ A = \pi r^2 \]
So far we don't know what is the value of number denoted by $\pi$. If we take a circle of unit radius, i.e., $r = 1$ then the area of circle turns, numerically, out to be $\pi$. We now calculate the area of unit circle geometrically. The area we calculate will, numerically, be the value of $\pi$ which we all are looking for in this paper.
			
\section{Area of unit circle}

	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{First two areas of the series in calculation of Area}
\end{figure}

We use our knowledge of calculating the area of triangle to calculate the area of circle by dividing the circle . Lets divide the circle into four quarters. In Figure.(\ref{fig:a_0}), we can approximate the area oc sector $OAB$ (say $S$) with the area of right triangle $\Delta OAB$. The are of $\Delta OAB$ is given simply by 
\[\text{Area of } \Delta OAB\, (A_0) = \frac{1}{2}OA \times OB = \frac{1}{2} \text{units} \]
In first approximation the area of sector $S $ is simply the area of triangle $\Delta OAB$, i.e., \[S_0 \approx A_0 = \Delta OAB\]
But we know this is a very crude approximation for the area of sector. We can improve this approximation. For that let us construct a line $OC$ through $O$ and the midpoint $D$ of $AB$ meeting the perimeter of circle at $C$. The approximation to the area of sector $OAB$ can now be improved by adding the area of two smaller triangles $\Delta DAC$ and $\Delta DBC$ which are equal in area (say $A_1$). The improved approximation to $S$  can be 
\begin{eqnarray}
S_1 &\approx& \Delta OAB + \Delta ADC + \Delta BDC \nonumber \\
&=& A_0 + 2A_1 \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
Similary, the approximation to the area can be improved by adding area of triangles in the gap left between the triangle and the circle further.
\begin{eqnarray}
S_2&\approx& A_0 + 2A_1+4A_2 \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
Where $A_2$ is the area of triangle $BDC$.

Continuing this way, the approximation to area of sector $S$ can be made as close to the actual area as we please by adding more and more triangles. And the series becomes
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:Series}
S_n = A_0 + 2A_1 + 4A_2 + 8A_3 + ... + 2^{n}A_n
\end{eqnarray}
And the exact area of sector $OAB$ is the limit of the sum $S_n$ as $n$ tends to $\infty$. i.e.,\[\text{Area of sector } OAB\, (S)= S_\infty = \sum_{n = 0}^{\infty} 2^{n}A_n \]
\section{Calculation}
Since we have assumed a unit circle, the length of sides $OA$ ($p_0$) and $OB$ ($b_0)$ corresponding to $\Delta OAB$ is unity. i.e.,

\begin{eqnarray}
p_0 (OA) &=& 1 \nonumber \\
b_0 (OB) &=& 1 \nonumber \\
h_0 (AB) &=& \sqrt{p_0^2+b_0^2} \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
Thus the area of $\Delta OAB (A_0) = \frac{1}{2}p_0 \times b_0 = \frac{1}{2}$. In $\Delta ACD$ in Figure.\ref{fig:a_1},

\begin{equation}
p_1 (CD) = OC - CD = 1 - \sqrt{OB^2 - DB^2}  =   1 - \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{AD}{2}\right)^2} = 1 - \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{h_0}{2}\right)^2} \nonumber
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
b_1 (AD) = \frac{AB}{2} =  \frac{h_0}{2} \qquad 
h_1 (AC) = \sqrt{p_1^2+b_1^2} \nonumber
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\text{Area of } \Delta ACD (A_1) = \frac{1}{2}p_1 \times b_1 \nonumber
\end{equation}
Continuing this way, the general  value of $A_n$ can easily be calculated with the knowledge of $p_n$ and $b_n$.
\begin{equation}
p_n = 1 - \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{h_{n-1}}{2}\right)^2} \nonumber
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
b_n  =  \frac{h_{n-1}}{2} \qquad 
h_n = \sqrt{p_n^2+b_n^2} \nonumber
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
A_n = \frac{1}{2}p_n \times b_n \nonumber
\end{equation}
Continuing this way we can calculate the value of every terms of Equation. (\ref{eq:Series}) and hence find the value of series as we please.

\section{Numerical Value}
We could write a simple python program to calculate the value of series in Equation. (\ref{eq:Series}).

	\caption{Plot of values of series as a function of $n$}
	\label{fig:PISeriesPlot}
\end{figure}
As seen in Figure.\ref{fig:PISeriesPlot} we see that the series converges rapidly to the actual value of $\pi$. In just 4 iterations we get the value with error of only $0.001\%$.
\section{Discussion}
Value of $\pi$ thus can be calculated with the beautiful series without much hassle, the geometric nature of its derivation can clearly be understood by high school level students without much difficulty.  We hope this paper helps remove the common confusion among the beginners about what actually $\pi$ is -- a number whose value is between $3$ and $4$ in real line, precisely $3.141592653589$ for 14 digit precision as we have calculated with the series proposed in this paper. The number $\pi$ in essentially like any  other number in real number system, the only difference being the location of it in real line. 

\section{Conclusion}
We have constructed one series that is very intuitively easy to get to and converges very fast to the value of $\pi$. We have calculated the numerical value of the series which is $3.14159...$ \cite{fat}.
